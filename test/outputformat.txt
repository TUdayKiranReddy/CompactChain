Number of elements
Key generation
Prime representative generation
Accumulation with private key 
Accumulation with public key
Witness generation with private key
Witness generation with public key
Verification of all elements

Notes:
All time values are in seconds
Prime representative generation will be "0" for bilinear-map accumulators, which don't need that step
Verification is always done with only public key information (though it can be done with private-key-generated witnesses and accumulators, it will take the exact same amount of time)
